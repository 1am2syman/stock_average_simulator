# Bond Calculator Simulator

This is a simple one-page HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application that simulates a bond calculator. It allows users to input bond details such as coupon rate, years to maturity, face value, and market yield to calculate the bond price, capital gain, total interest earned, and Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR).

## Features

- Calculate bond price based on coupon rate, maturity, face value, and market yield.
- Determine capital gain.
- Calculate total interest earned based on years held.
- Calculate CAGR if capital gain is realized.
- Provides a basic explanation of present value calculations.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enter the bond details in the provided input fields.
4. Click the "Calculate" button to see the results.

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic for the simulator.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## Future Improvements

- Add more advanced bond calculations (e.g., yield to maturity).
- Implement input validation.
- Improve the user interface and styling.
- Add support for different coupon payment frequencies (e.g., semi-annual).
